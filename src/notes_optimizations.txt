            // on the dom_manipulations_functions / page_initializer file?

        // Utilized button.diasble in the onclick fn and then set it back to false in the runDrawPoker() fn

        // can I remove the event listener then add the below??
        //
        // Split the DOM and the Updating of the Hold attribute components, is working now.
        // Done...

    Issue: Prompt for playing again pops up the number of times that rounds are played, need to fix

        // Add a div below to show the Amount Won

    Issue: Add mouseover hover to the Hold buttons
        // 

    Issue: Add Documentation
    // Don’t underestimate the importance of high quality documentation on your projects. 
        // As a professional developer writing good documentation is a must. As a job seeker 
        // it’s a hidden opportunity to shine. Your projects should include a useful README and 
        // at least one screenshot. Include a section about why you built the project 
        // and another section with instructions to run the project locally.

        // Remember to write some documentation for both technical and non-technical audience.
        // A potential employer should be able to follow your documentation, regardless of their technical background.
